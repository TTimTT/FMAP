# FMAP
### *Free Music Alternative Playlists*
# Abstract
It can be tough to know what we would like to listen when faced with an archive of thousand of musics. For our project we wondered how we could automatically generate a list of songs that would correspond to one's taste using the [Free Music Archive avalaible](http://freemusicarchive.org/) on the internet.


# Dataset
Since the dataset is quite large, to use these scripts you have to download the following
data: [fma_metadata.zip](https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_metadata.zip) (342 MiB).
